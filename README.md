# mylibrary
Simple tool for analyzing some book collections with the goodreads API.
Need to have your own goodreads API key/secret key pair in a top-level file named 'secret.config'

# TODO:
# - genres/keyword tags for all books
# - list of collection intersection between us for potential reading dates, specifically the least popular books in the intersection bc that’d be interesting
# - most common authors in our collections
# - i think it’d be cool to try the cluster the book by genre/even sentiment analysis and see if my collection comes up with 4 distinct clusters (me, leeraz, mom, dad)
# - i’m also going to add a “have i read this?” column so i can tell how much of our collection i’ve actually read, and make a “i wanna read a new book” feature that spits out a book i haven’t read yet
# - also maybe a “i wanna reminisce by reading an old book” feature
# - maybe publishing year of all the books, see if we can find the oldest/newest books in our collections
# - oh also i think goodreads might have a “book suggestions given collection” endpoint, so it’d be cool to see what it recommends for us
# - goodreads ratings for all books
# - longest and shortest titles.
# - most common key words in titles.
